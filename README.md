The [Starbridge](https://foundation.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Bridge) is a front end web page which collects the available data at [Invictus API](https://github.com/brunolcarli/Invictus) to present it in a more friendly and organized view, like charts, reports, queryable information and model prediction through the communication and interaction with the API. In resume, the scope of the page (and the whole system) is to crawl data from the [Ogame](https://lobby.ogame.gameforge.com/pt_BR/hub) universe in time to time with purposes of store statistical data over time from player(s) growth ingame. All collected data is originally gathered from ogame gameforge API and stored in a relational database. No data exposed goes against game rules and are intended for statistical and tactical use only.

Currently the only universe (Ogame server) explored is the `br144`.
